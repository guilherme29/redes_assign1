# Network Communications class assignment. 
A Server and a Chat client to communicate.

## To test it:
compile it with javac
run the server with a listening port as argument
```Shell
  java ChatServer 4444
```
run the client with the server IP adress and the listening port
```Shell
  java ChatClient 127.0.0.1 4444
```

This project is finished, at least for now. 
My grade on this wasn't as good as I expected because there were some unexpected bugs. Those are still missing a corrections!
For the most part, however, everything works as intended! :D
